## Strategies

Users will be able to create and manage strategies. Strategies are comprised of the following:

### Phases

Each strategy will have multiple phases. The creator can name these phases for better clarity. By clicking on a phase in the list, the user can bring up a list of all the steps in that phase.

### Steps

Each phase can have multiple steps. By pressing the play button, the user will be able to view each step in order. Alternatively, they can cycle through each step by clicking on the desired step number. Job and boss icons will move around the map from one step to the next to provide better clarity when it comes to player movement.

The core functionality of this app occurs at the step level. Players are given the option of either a circle or square arena shape and can place job, enemy, number/letter, aoe, and ability markers as they desire.

Strategies/phases/steps will be saved and can be shared between players.
